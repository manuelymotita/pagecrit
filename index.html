		<h1 id="title">Good Design.</h1>
			<p>
				The reason I liked the layout of this page was due to it's simple, 
				clean and elegant design. The page uses a simple color scheme, as well
				as simple to read text. Hierarchy is achieved by altering the weight of
				the text, and although the paragraphs type is bigger than the titles, 
				because the title is bold, one can clearly tell the difference. Furthermore,
				I also liked that the designer omitted to use images, or at least gives
				the impression of doing so.

		<h1 id="title">Bad Design.</h1>
			<p>
				I don't like this page for many reasons; Imagery, colors, font size,
				amongst other things. First I'll talk about the images. There are lots of 
				pictures all over the page. There are images on the top, body, 
				background, and finally and most intrusive, the bottom. For some strange 
				reason, the designer decided to place these images at the bottom that are 
				always present regardless of scrolling. These images are very distracting 
				and they take up a lot of room in the page. Second thing I'll approach is 
				color. There is a lot of color in this page. The background, the body, and 
				the navigation all have different colors, not to mention the images themselves.
				Not only is there a lot of color in the page, the colors don't compliment 
				each other either; Rather, they make the page look dated and tacky. overall
				I don't like the colors on the page. Finally I'll tackle the typography in
				the page. The choice of font is not what bothers me about this page.
				What bothers me is the font size. In my opinion the font should be a bit bigger
				to help with the legibility, it would also help the page by making it look
				less cluttered.

		<h1 id="title">Conclusion</h1>
			<p>
				They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and that might be true to some
				extent, but there are things that are just plain ugly. Such is the case with 
				the page I chose as an example for bad design. My philosophy is "Simplicity is virtue."
				It is easy to just add and add content to make a page look good, but to make simple elegant, 
				now that is a whole different story.
